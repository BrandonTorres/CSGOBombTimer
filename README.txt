# CSGOBombTimer
A simple timer that is can be integrated with CS:GO's game state. Once CS:GO game state is "planted" then the countdown will begin.

How to Run
1. Build the project and make sure that BombData.txt is in the same folder as the .exe
2. Run Program.

A server will need to be established that writes the game state to BombData.txt. An example on how to do this using a local server 
and node.js is shown on the valve developer website:https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration
